# Tower-of-Hanoi
A Tower of Hanoi game which allows you to choose the number of "cheeses" and "stools".

This is the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, but with a few additions to it. This game can be played with a GUI.
There is a counter which counts the number of moves which have been made, located at the bottom.

It is also possible to set the amount of cheeses and stools which will be in the game. For example, we may
start the game with 5 cheeses, and 5 stools.
